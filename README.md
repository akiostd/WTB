Governance Challenges in Decentralized Organizations
In a decentralized digital world, ideally every decision is made based on community consensus.

However, we often see that these systems, despite their aim for transparency and participation, can be slow, noisy, and even resemble frivolous governance theater.

The main problem arises when too much of a community energy and resources are drained on futile proposal and low-impact initiatives.

This hinders meaningful progress. Delayed discussion can lag behind, arguments get drained on minutiae, and the lack of effective mechanisms for filtering high-quality ideas can leave organisation stagnant. Rather than focusing on innovation, attention is diverted to less productive internal dynamics.

# Example 
[Community Playground Program]
Imagine a decentralized community program, let’s call it “BEone.” Its primary goal is to build a livable park for people in need, with decisions about land allocation, design, and budget determined by community participation.

Initially, the spirit of decentralization was very much in the air. Any member of the community could submit a proposal.

One person proposed a surfboard on lot A.

Another proposed a modern minimalist shade design.

Another proposed using environmentally friendly materials.

However, as time went on, problems began to emerge.

# [I]. Slow
The voting process for each proposal took weeks, even months. Building proposals were delayed by having to wait for all community members to agree on small details like paint color or roof type.

# [II]. Noisy
Discussion forums were flooded with unfocused debate. Community members argued heatedly about whether the park should have wooden or stone benches, while fundamental issues like the availability of clean water at the construction site remained unresolved.

# [III]. Governance Theater
Some proposals were submitted not because of their urgency, but rather to attract attention or personal interests. For example, there was a proposal to hold a useless campaign festival every month in the development area, which was clearly irrelevant to the main objective of the housing program, but still took up time and resources for discussion.

# [IV]. Wasted Resources
Core team time and program budget were spent heavily on managing thousands of comments, moderating unproductive debates, and compiling reports on proposals that were never approved. This resulted in construction that should have been carried out quickly being severely delayed, and funds that should have been used for construction were instead spent on inefficient governance operational costs and personal relationships.

In this scenario, despite the good intentions to decentralize and empower the community, the lack of efficient mechanisms and clear innovation can turn the process into a roadblock to progress. 

Such organizations/DAOs will then have to find ways to restructure or even replace their governance systems in order to get back to their core mission and achieve their goals. [But consumer trust will be lost]
